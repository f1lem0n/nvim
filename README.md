# f1lem0n's oldschool NEOVIM build

## Welcome

After installation NEOVIM should open up.
If this is not the case, then error message should show up.
The message shall be saved in nvim/install.err file in case
you would like to analyse it further.
You may encounter an error message when exiting NEOVIM after
the installation. It surely pops up due to my lack of skill
in bash and I will try to get rid of it in the following versions.
Enjoy using my oldschool build!

## Version

As for now, the installation script is dedicated to debian 
based software using apt package manager.

- NEOVIM v0.4.4
- build v1.2

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:f1lem0n/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim

# f1lem0n's oldschool NEOVIM build

## About

### General

This is my oldschool looking, high-contrast NEOVIM build.
It's mainly used for Python, Snakemake, $\LaTeX$ and Markdown.
The full list of plugins is available in ***init.vim*** file.

### Errors

*After the installation NEOVIM should open up.
If this is not the case, then you should see the error message.
The message shall be saved in **install.err** file in case
you would like to analyse it further.
You may encounter an error message when exiting NEOVIM after
the installation. It surely pops up due to my lack of skill
in bash and I will try to get rid of it in the following versions.*

Enjoy using my build!
